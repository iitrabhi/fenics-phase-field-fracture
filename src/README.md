### 1. Generate the Mesh

Navigate to the **mesh** folder and open the Jupyter notebook inside it. Run all the cells to generate the mesh file needed for simulation. This will create the necessary `.xdmf` mesh file for the domain.

### 2. Run the Simulation

After generating the mesh, open the **`main.ipynb`** notebook. Run all the cells to execute the AT2 phase-field fracture simulation. The results will be saved in the **output** folder. You can open the `.xdmf` file inside this folder using **ParaView** to visualize the simulation results.
